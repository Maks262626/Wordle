# Wordle Game Clone

Welcome to the Wordle Game Clone! This project is inspired by the popular word puzzle game Wordle, but with a twist - you can play it as many times as you want, without any daily limits.

## About the Game

Wordle is a classic word puzzle game where the goal is to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, you receive feedback in the form of colored tiles:

- Green: The letter is in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is not in the word at all.

Your objective is to deduce the hidden word within the given attempts. It's a fun and challenging game that tests your word-guessing skills.

## Features

- **Unlimited Gameplay**: Unlike the original Wordle, there are no daily limits here. You can play as many rounds as you'd like, whenever you want.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive immediate feedback on your guesses with colored tiles to help you deduce the word.
